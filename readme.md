# Galaxybot

Discover the galaxies of the universe from your fingertips and try to find them all. Users who find every galaxy will earn a special badge, like a pokedex for the universe.

## Inspiration

We were inspired by our collective interest in astronomy and wanted to make stargazing from home accessible with a low barrier to entry

## What it does

You can run commands from discord that allow you to discover galaxies with varying rarities, giving you points with each discovery. You can use these points to buy upgrades to your telescope, called "charms", which make finding rarer discoveries much easier!

## How we built it

We used python, pycord, bash, json, and the wikipedia API in order to create an immersive and interactive experience from the comfort of discord

## Challenges we ran into

Issues that we ran into had to do with implementing the rarities and charms of galaxies. We settled for an object oriented approach to the galaxies, where the weights for rarities would be added on command run, so that we could add the charm values to the rarities.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of the variety of galaxies we have available to discover, as well as the simplicity of our code. We built our project out on the DRY principle, Don't Repeat Yourself. Our code is condensed into smaller functions and used throughout the project.

## What we learned

We learned how to efficiently integrate python and JSON, using git and GitHub for group collaboration, and how to create a shop/barter system in discord bots

## What's next for Galaxybot

We plan to add more galaxies to explore and discover, a much more robust barter system and more interesting and novel telescope upgrades, as well as permanent server hosting in the future.
