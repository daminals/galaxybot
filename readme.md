# Galaxybot
Hey Hoya Hacks, weâ€™re excited to showcase our project Galaxybot, a discord bot that sends facts and images of various galaxies across the universe - by Daniel Kogan, Aritro Sarkar, and Taseen Islam.

Invite it to your personal discord server and all you have to do is send >galaxy into a text channel where the bot has permission to send messages. This will call onto galaxybot and send a snippet of information and an image of a random galaxy

A user will gain points each time they use this command and call on galaxybot. The galaxy that galaxybot sends is random, but some galaxies are much more rare to show up than others. Therefore, a user will gain more points proportional to the rarity of the galaxy.

But what do you do with points? You exchange them at the galaxy shop! You can buy various items such as the basic charm, super charm, and galactic charm. The basic charm (costing 500 pts) helps rare galaxies to show up more frequently, the super charm (2000 pts) has 5x this effect, and the galactic charm (5000 pts) has 3x the effect of a super charm!

Discover the galaxies of the universe from your fingertips and try to find them all. Users who find every galaxy will earn a special badge, kind of like the pokedex but for galaxies.

Gotta discover them all!
